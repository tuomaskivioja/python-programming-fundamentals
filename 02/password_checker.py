# Write a program that checks which of the passwords inside PASSWORDS meet the 3 following criteria:
# 1. Minimum characters of 7
# 2. Must contain at least one special character (defined in SPECIAL_CHARACTERS)
# 3. Must include at least one number
# Tip: You may want to loop over PASSWORDS and use multiple if conditions
